# CCTV - Tracking

The Tracking of faces are simple if the person is not moving and the face or attributes on which the AI model is trained then the accuracy can be attained at higher rates.
But when it comes to a moving obejct we need to assess the person to be identified and based on the attributes if there are similar attributes we can identify the person we are looking for, but from different angles that's where the big guns need to be used such as #Egien faces where the faces from -90 degree to +90 degree in X-axis and +90 degree to -90 degree in Y-axis.
If there is any problem arises we need to use DeepLearning Methods for better accuracy of our model.
